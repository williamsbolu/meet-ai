// Our auth config was a bit different from the docs because of the auth-schema.ts file which i deleted and moved its contents to my main schema files. Thats why i added the schema directly also to the adapter to avoid errors

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
    provider: "pg",
    schema: {
      ...schema,
    },

    google: {
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID as string,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET as string,

});

// ? When you use the import * as syntax in React: You're importing everything that's exported from the @/db/schema module as a single object named schema
