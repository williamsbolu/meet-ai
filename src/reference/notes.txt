1. 6hr: 23min: explanation of errors encountered when passing query params or queryOptions in useSuspenseQuery on the client side ignoring prefetched data on the serverside. causing the useSuspenseQuery to fallback to useQuery ignoring and disabling the prefetch. This is something i should always note and consider whenever using Trcp for prefetching on the server-side and accessing the data on the client using useSuspenseQuery. i must make sure the same queryOptions is passed to both file hooks
